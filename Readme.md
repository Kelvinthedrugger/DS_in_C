#### Description

	Implementation of Data Structure in C

#### Real Description

	Mainly served as a backup utility so that I don't have to re-type
	everything from scratch when I don't have access to my laptop

#### Notes

	Mainly developed on Windows 10, don't blame me for not using Unix-like sys.

	If you find the content useful, don't be stingy on giving stars

	VIM on Windows is hard for me

	makeit.c is now slow tho there is barely any memory occupied, need speed & low level hack on this

#### Tips

   from command line, run below to compile the file (on Windows)


	gcc YourFile.c -o YourFile


   for ppl who don't want to type out long command, type this alternatively (also on Windows)
   (Attention, you have to compile makeit.c first if you didn't see makeit.exe in your folder)

	>>> makeit YourFile
	result of Yourfile.exe shown here	

   you'll see the same YourFile.exe popping out in the folder, just run it if you would

   add makeit.exe to PATH variable on your device might help you to make .c file anywhere 
   not just in this folder (not tested)
