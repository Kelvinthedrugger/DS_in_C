binomial heap:

/*
   before forming cir lktlist, we join pairs of min tree
   that have same degree until there aren't any

min: 0: empty binHeap
insert:
	first putting x into a newNode()
	-> insert node into cir lktlist pointer by min
	-> if node < min or min == 0: update min to node
	time: O(1)
meld:
	meld the top linked lists into 1 singly cir lktlist
	-> make the smaller one to be min node
	time: O(1)
delete:
	min is removed from its cir lktlist
	-> new b-heap consists of the remaining subtrees

 summary steps:
 	1. merge the trees
	2. form singly cir lktlists
	3. declare min and point it

	void joinMinTree(root_large, root_small): 
		make root_large the child of root_small

	A single node can be viewed as tree ?
