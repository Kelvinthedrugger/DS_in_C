 do DS here since it allows you to compare different program more quickly

 then move hws into ~/desktop/seninfo/ds/hwx

 update to ~/documents/github/dss/c either, as a motivation to work hard


 About HWs: construct DSs here to fully experiment it 
		,and merge to ../../seninfo/hw later

 HW3:

	leftistTree.c (done) + binHeap.c(not done)
	minmaxheap done insertion following the textbook, deletion not done

	AVL + red-black

	Algorithm to search and delete keys from a B-tree by position

	B+ tree for exact range search, insert and delete
